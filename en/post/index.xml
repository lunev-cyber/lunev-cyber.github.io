      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-of-june-23-to-june-29&#34;&gt;üìå Week of June 23 to June 29&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exam session is over! We took the last exam in databases. The results are encouraging ‚Äî no failed subjects so far. I‚Äôm really glad I managed to handle such a large amount of information in a short time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week there was finally time to relax: we went on a tour around Moscow with friends, and I finally got a chance to read for pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to improve my English and dive deeper into SQL over the summer ‚Äî lots of new things ahead!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-of-june-16-to-june-22&#34;&gt;üìå Week of June 16 to June 22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exam session was in full swing. We took the economics exam ‚Äî the questions were quite challenging, but preparation paid off. The programming exam went better than I expected: the tasks on loops and arrays were quite manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized that during exams, having a clear answer plan and the ability to quickly highlight the key points helps the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After classes, we would go out on campus with friends ‚Äî just to get some fresh air and discuss how the exams went.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Third Week ‚Äî Exam Preparation and New Challenges</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-of-june-9-to-june-15&#34;&gt;üìå Week of June 9 to June 15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main event of the week was active preparation for exams. In the evenings, we gathered at the library ‚Äî working together to solve economics problems and creating cheat sheets for information theory (just for knowledge checking üòâ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In programming class, we worked on a mini-project: a simple expense tracking application. It was useful to apply theory in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a bit tough to balance studying and sports, but I managed to make it to volleyball practice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-of-june-2-to-june-8&#34;&gt;üìå Week of June 2 to June 8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The week turned out to be eventful. We took a test in mathematical analysis ‚Äî the tasks were more challenging than I expected, but the experience was valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In business process practice, we started working on a group project: modeling the business process of an online store. We created a BPMN diagram ‚Äî it turned out to be more interesting than it sounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also began exploring SQL ‚Äî the database homework really made me work hard.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First Week of Studies ‚Äî New Impressions and Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://lunev-cyber.github.io/en/post/01/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-of-may-26-to-june-1&#34;&gt;üìå Week of May 26 to June 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week marked the start of a new academic cycle. It was a bit exciting and a little stressful at first because the business informatics subjects seemed quite extensive. What stood out most were the first lectures on information systems ‚Äî the lecturer shared real-life implementation cases from major companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical programming classes began with an introduction to Python basics. I was surprised at how quickly time flies when writing code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of classes, I got to know my classmates ‚Äî we prepared together for an economics seminar. It feels like a lot of interesting things lie ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
