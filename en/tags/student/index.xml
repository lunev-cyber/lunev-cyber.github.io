&lt;p&gt;The exam session was in full swing. We took the economics exam ‚Äî the questions were quite challenging, but preparation paid off. The programming exam went better than I expected: the tasks on loops and arrays were quite manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized that during exams, having a clear answer plan and the ability to quickly highlight the key points helps the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After classes, we would go out on campus with friends ‚Äî just to get some fresh air and discuss how the exams went.&lt;/p&gt;
