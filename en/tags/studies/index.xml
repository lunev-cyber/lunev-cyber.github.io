      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-of-june-2-to-june-8&#34;&gt;üìå Week of June 2 to June 8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The week turned out to be eventful. We took a test in mathematical analysis ‚Äî the tasks were more challenging than I expected, but the experience was valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In business process practice, we started working on a group project: modeling the business process of an online store. We created a BPMN diagram ‚Äî it turned out to be more interesting than it sounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also began exploring SQL ‚Äî the database homework really made me work hard.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First Week of Studies ‚Äî New Impressions and Adaptation</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-of-may-26-to-june-1&#34;&gt;üìå Week of May 26 to June 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week marked the start of a new academic cycle. It was a bit exciting and a little stressful at first because the business informatics subjects seemed quite extensive. What stood out most were the first lectures on information systems ‚Äî the lecturer shared real-life implementation cases from major companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical programming classes began with an introduction to Python basics. I was surprised at how quickly time flies when writing code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of classes, I got to know my classmates ‚Äî we prepared together for an economics seminar. It feels like a lot of interesting things lie ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
