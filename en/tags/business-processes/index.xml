      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-of-june-2-to-june-8&#34;&gt;üìå Week of June 2 to June 8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The week turned out to be eventful. We took a test in mathematical analysis ‚Äî the tasks were more challenging than I expected, but the experience was valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In business process practice, we started working on a group project: modeling the business process of an online store. We created a BPMN diagram ‚Äî it turned out to be more interesting than it sounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also began exploring SQL ‚Äî the database homework really made me work hard.&lt;/p&gt;
