&lt;p&gt;The exam session is over! We took the last exam in databases. The results are encouraging ‚Äî no failed subjects so far. I‚Äôm really glad I managed to handle such a large amount of information in a short time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week there was finally time to relax: we went on a tour around Moscow with friends, and I finally got a chance to read for pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to improve my English and dive deeper into SQL over the summer ‚Äî lots of new things ahead!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exam session was in full swing. We took the economics exam ‚Äî the questions were quite challenging, but preparation paid off. The programming exam went better than I expected: the tasks on loops and arrays were quite manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized that during exams, having a clear answer plan and the ability to quickly highlight the key points helps the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After classes, we would go out on campus with friends ‚Äî just to get some fresh air and discuss how the exams went.&lt;/p&gt;
